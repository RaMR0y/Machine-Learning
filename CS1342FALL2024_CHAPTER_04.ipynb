        "#### **What is a Dictionary in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "A **dictionary** in Python is like a real-world dictionary but instead of words and their definitions, it holds **keys** and their **associated values**. Think of it as a container that holds pairs of items where each key is unique and maps to a specific value. This structure allows you to quickly look up information, much like how you use a word to find its meaning in a regular dictionary.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Key**: The identifier you use to find the information (e.g., a word in a dictionary).\n",
        "- **Value**: The information associated with the key (e.g., the definition of the word).\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **Real-World Analogy**\n",
        "\n",
        "Imagine you have a list of employees, and you want to store their job titles, email addresses, and departments. You could use a dictionary where each employee's name is the key, and their details are stored as the value. This allows you to quickly find or update an employee's information without having to search through a list.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **Why Use a Dictionary?**\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Quick Access**: You can quickly find a value if you know the key.\n",
        "- **Uniqueness**: Each key in a dictionary is unique, which means you won’t have duplicate entries.\n",
        "- **Mutability**: You can change, add, or remove key-value pairs at any time.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Creating Dictionaries**\n",
        "\n",
        "There are several ways to create dictionaries in Python. Let's explore a few of them.\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Empty Dictionary**:\n",
        "   - Start with an empty dictionary and add entries later.\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   my_dict = {}  # An empty dictionary\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Pre-filled Dictionary**:\n",
        "   - Start with a dictionary that already has some data.\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   phonebook = {\"Alice\": \"123-456-7890\", \"Bob\": \"987-654-3210\"}\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Using the `dict()` Constructor**:\n",
        "   - Create a dictionary using the `dict()` function, often with keyword arguments.\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   employee = dict(name=\"John Doe\", age=30, department=\"HR\")\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Using `zip()` to Pair Keys and Values**:\n",
        "   - Combine two lists or sequences into a dictionary.\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   keys = [\"name\", \"age\", \"department\"]\n",
        "   values = [\"Jane Smith\", 25, \"IT\"]\n",
        "   employee = dict(zip(keys, values))\n",
        "   # employee = {'name': 'Jane Smith', 'age': 25, 'department': 'IT'}\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Using Dictionary Comprehension**:\n",
        "   - Create a dictionary from an iterable or conditionally.\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   squares = {x: x**2 for x in range(6)}\n",
        "   # squares = {0: 0, 1: 1, 2: 4, 3: 9, 4: 16, 5: 25}\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "   - **Conditional Dictionary Comprehension**:\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   even_squares = {x: x**2 for x in range(10) if x % 2 == 0}\n",
        "   # even_squares = {0: 0, 2: 4, 4: 16, 6: 36, 8: 64}\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Accessing Values in a Dictionary**\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Direct Access**: If you know the key, you can access the value directly.\n",
        "  ```python\n",
        "  bob_number = phonebook[\"Bob\"]  # \"987-654-3210\"\n",
        "  ```\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Using `get()` Method**: This is safer as it won’t cause an error if the key doesn’t exist. It returns `None` or a default value if the key is not found.\n",
        "  ```python\n",
        "  alice_number = phonebook.get(\"Alice\")  # \"123-456-7890\"\n",
        "  unknown_number = phonebook.get(\"Unknown\", \"Not Found\")  # \"Not Found\"\n",
        "  ```\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Modifying a Dictionary**\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Adding or Updating Entries**: Easily add a new key-value pair or update an existing one.\n",
        "  ```python\n",
        "  phonebook[\"Eve\"] = \"333-333-3333\"  # Adds new entry for Eve\n",
        "  phonebook[\"Alice\"] = \"111-111-1111\"  # Updates Alice's number\n",
        "  ```\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Adding or Updating Multiple Entries**: Easily update dictionary with new entries.\n",
        "  ```python\n",
        "  new_contacts = {\"kate\": \"000-000-0000\", \"hurley\": \"111-111-1111\"}\n",
        "  phonebook.update(new_contacts)\n",
        "  ```\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Removing Entries**: You can remove an entry by its key.\n",
        "  ```python\n",
        "  del phonebook[\"Bob\"]  # Removes Bob's entry\n",
        "  ```\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Working with Dictionary Methods**\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Check if a Key Exists**: Useful to see if someone’s information is in the phonebook.\n",
        "  ```python\n",
        "  if \"Charlie\" in phonebook:\n",
        "      print(\"Charlie's number is available.\")\n",
        "  ```\n",

        "  keys = phonebook.keys()  # Returns all keys (names)\n",
        "  values = phonebook.values()  # Returns all values (phone numbers)\n",
        "  key, value = phonebook.items()  # Returns all key-value pairs\n",
